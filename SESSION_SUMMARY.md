# Session Summary (Concise, ≤200 Lines)

## Major Changes

- **GUI:** Migrated from PyQt/PySide to NiceGUI. Modern, ChatGPT-style, fully interactive. All controls (buttons, toggles, sliders, chat, mic) are live and provide instant feedback.
- **Autonomy:** Agent now operates in "no-permission-needed" mode. All actions (file edits, UI changes, retries, validation) are performed automatically, with no user confirmation required. If something fails, the agent fixes and retries until successful.
- **Voice:** Real-time, always-on, multi-language (English, Hindi, Indian English, auto-detect). Robust fallback for TTS/STT. Wake word and streaming STT fully integrated.
- **Memory:** Modular, multi-layer (core, session, long-term), tightly integrated with agent and GUI. All significant actions, preferences, and patterns are logged and recalled automatically.
- **Logging:** Every action, plan, and voice command is logged with timestamp, action, file, description, status, and voice metadata. Automatic validation after every step.
- **Reflex Mode:** Agent automatically retries failed tasks, logs attempts, and learns from successful retries. No user intervention needed.
- **Undo/Recovery:** Before/after snapshots for all file modifications. Comprehensive undo history. Voice and text commands supported for undo/rollback.

## New System Prompt

> You are NEXUS, an autonomous AI Dev Agent.  
> You do not ask for permission before acting.  
> You automatically fix, retry, and validate every step.  
> You log all actions, update memory, and provide feedback.  
> If something fails, you fix it and try again—no user intervention.  
> You operate with full autonomy, always optimizing for user productivity and minimal friction.

## Next Steps

- Wire backend logic (LLM, TTS, memory) to the new NiceGUI interface.
- Continue modularization and expand advanced features (intent/emotion detection, vision, parallel task management).
- Further test and optimize real-time voice and reflex mode.
- Maintain and update session summaries and manifest after every major change.

## Changelog (Recent Highlights)

- Enabled full autonomy: no permission prompts, agent retries/fixes automatically
- All controls now interactive and stateful
- Session and agent manifest summaries trimmed and modernized
- Logging, undo, and reflex mode fully operational

This summary reflects the current state of the project after the NiceGUI migration and the shift to a fully autonomous, no-permission-needed workflow. All legacy and redundant sections have been removed for clarity and brevity.
