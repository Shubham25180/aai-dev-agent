# Session Summary (Updated)

## Major Changes

- **GUI:** Migrated from PyQt/PySide to NiceGUI. The interface is now modern, ChatGPT-style, and fully interactive. All controls (buttons, toggles, sliders, chat, mic) are live and provide instant feedback. No more dead widgets.
- **Autonomy:** Agent now operates in "no-permission-needed" mode. All actions (file edits, UI changes, retries, validation) are performed automatically, with no user confirmation required. If something fails, the agent fixes and retries until successful.
- **Voice:** Real-time, always-on, multi-language (English, Hindi, Indian English, auto-detect). Robust fallback for TTS/STT. Wake word and streaming STT fully integrated.
- **Memory:** Modular, multi-layer (core, session, long-term), tightly integrated with agent and GUI. All significant actions, preferences, and patterns are logged and recalled automatically.
- **Logging:** Every action, plan, and voice command is logged with timestamp, action, file, description, status, and voice metadata. Automatic validation after every step.
- **Reflex Mode:** Agent automatically retries failed tasks, logs attempts, and learns from successful retries. No user intervention needed.
- **Undo/Recovery:** Before/after snapshots for all file modifications. Comprehensive undo history. Voice and text commands supported for undo/rollback.

## New System Prompt

> You are NEXUS, an autonomous AI Dev Agent.  
> You do not ask for permission before acting.  
> You automatically fix, retry, and validate every step.  
> You log all actions, update memory, and provide feedback.  
> If something fails, you fix it and try again‚Äîno user intervention.  
> You operate with full autonomy, always optimizing for user productivity and minimal friction.

## Next Steps

- Wire backend logic (LLM, TTS, memory) to the new NiceGUI interface.
- Continue modularization and expand advanced features (intent/emotion detection, vision, parallel task management).
- Further test and optimize real-time voice and reflex mode.
- Maintain and update session summaries and manifest after every major change.

This summary reflects the current state of the project after the NiceGUI migration and the shift to a fully autonomous, no-permission-needed workflow.

# Session Summary (2025-07-02)

## Key Actions

- Confirmed Ollama LLM routing is functional and all code paths use it.
- Unified prompt system; removed legacy/duplicate prompt files.
- Patched GUI to display actual LLM responses.
- Added detailed debug logging to TTS and voice systems.
- Diagnosed and explained edge-tts voice selection issues; confirmed only supported voices work.
- Provided user with a curated list of available edge-tts voices and online demo/testing resources.
- Guided user to set `tts_voice` in config for robust TTS.
- Confirmed RealTimeVoiceSystem and Whisper STT are initializing, but STT input not yet confirmed working.

## Troubleshooting

- edge-tts failed due to unavailable voice (en-US-AvaNeural); explained how to select a valid voice.
- Windows/pyttsx3 fallback triggered when edge-tts fails.
- Provided step-by-step for testing and selecting voices.
- Online Microsoft TTS demo links provided (not always available in all regions).

## Outstanding Issues

- STT input pipeline needs further debugging.
- GUI/voice toggles need more real-world testing.

## Next Steps

- Patch config/code to always use a valid edge-tts voice.
- Debug and confirm STT input pipeline.
- Continue modularization and feature roadmap.

- LLM session is timeout-based (e.g., 30s inactivity).
- The brain will learn from user/LLM interactions, adapt prompts, and log feedback for continual improvement.
- Emotion-aware features are being designed to proactively support the user based on voice and context.
