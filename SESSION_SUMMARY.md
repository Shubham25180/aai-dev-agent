# Session Summary (Updated)

## Major Changes

- **GUI:** Migrated back to a Python-native GUI (PyQt6 or NiceGUI) for simplicity and solo developer velocity. The interface is now a single-process, modern desktop app with chat, voice, and automation controls. No more frontend/backend split, CORS, or WebSocket glue.
- **Automation:** Reusing gui_hybrid modules: ActionRouter, Vision (OCR/YOLO), LLMPlanner, Executor (pyautogui). All GUI automation and LLM/voice logic is now called directly from the GUI.
- **LLM/Voice:** Direct integration—no REST or WebSocket needed. Always-on voice, TTS, and LLM are all Python-native and event-driven.
- **Logging/Memory:** All actions, plans, and voice commands are logged as before. Undo/redo and memory features remain, but are now simpler to wire up.
- **Reflex Mode:** Agent still retries failed tasks and learns from user patterns, but with less infrastructure overhead.
- **Undo/Recovery:** Snapshots and undo/redo are still supported, now managed in-process.
- **Removed:** The React+FastAPI web stack is no longer the main UI. All controls and chat are in the Python GUI.

## New System Prompt

> You are NEXUS, an autonomous AI Dev Agent.  
> You do not ask for permission before acting.  
> You automatically fix, retry, and validate every step.  
> You log all actions, update memory, and provide feedback.  
> If something fails, you fix it and try again—no user intervention.  
> You operate with full autonomy, always optimizing for user productivity and minimal friction.

## Next Steps

- Polish the PyQt6/NiceGUI interface: chat, toggles, voice, and automation.
- Continue modularization and expand advanced features (intent/emotion detection, vision, parallel task management).
- Further test and optimize real-time voice and reflex mode.
- Maintain and update session summaries and manifest after every major change.
