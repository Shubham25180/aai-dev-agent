## üß© Modular Architecture (Organs, Brain, Feedback)

- **Ear:** Whisper, VAD (voice to text, silence detection) ‚Äî **DONE**
- **Speech Emotion:** TextBlob/VADER (CPU-only) ‚Äî **IN PROGRESS**
- **Vision/GUI:** PyAutoGUI, screen logger ‚Äî **DONE/BASIC**
- **Memory:** SQLite, JSON, ChromaDB ‚Äî **DONE** (Core, Session, Long-Term fully integrated)
- **Mood:** Mood-state tracker (rule-based, to be expanded) ‚Äî **PLANNED**
- **Feedback:** Log user/LLM interaction, prompt success/failure ‚Äî **PLANNED**

### Brain (Python Orchestrator)
- Receives signals from all organs
- Maintains session state (mood, topic, history)
- Decides when to:
  - Call LLM (wake word, intent, memory trigger)
  - Log/wait (ambient)
  - Give emotional comfort (emotion detected)
- Beautifies and personalizes LLM output before TTS/GUI
- Writes logs to long-term memory
- Schedules self-analysis (summarization, prompt tuning)

### Feedback & Learning
- Logs all interactions, user feedback, and outcomes
- Feedback loop for prompt tuning and adaptation (planned)
- Scheduled self-analysis and rule updates (planned)

## üß† Stepwise Implementation Plan (CPU-Only)

1. **Prompt Feedback & Analytics**
   - Log every prompt, user edit, and LLM result
   - Add feedback (üëç/üëé, edit & resend) in GUI
   - Store feedback in memory for analytics
2. **Rule-Based Intent & Mood Detection**
   - Use keyword/regex for intent
   - Use TextBlob/VADER for sentiment (text only)
3. **Memory-Driven Adaptation**
   - Use session/long-term memory to remember user preferences, successful prompts, and feedback
4. **Knowledge Search (RAG)**
   - Use ChromaDB/LlamaIndex for document/context retrieval (CPU)
5. **Persona/Style Switching**
   - Let user pick persona/tone in GUI; use templates/rules to adjust responses
6. **Modular, Extensible Design**
   - All organs (memory, rules, feedback, GUI, etc.) modular and swappable

---

## üß¨ Unified System Flow (CPU-Only)

1. **Input**: Voice (VAD/Whisper), GUI, or external event (all CPU)
2. **Preprocessing**: Rule-based emotion/tone/intent detection, persona/context tagging
3. **Decision**:
   - If brain can handle: use rules/memory/templates
   - If not: generate/refine prompt, show for feedback/edit
   - If approved: call LLM (CPU-only, or remote/cloud if needed)
4. **LLM Call**: Routed to best model/agent/tool (CPU-only)
5. **Postprocessing**: Brain beautifies, personalizes, and formats response
6. **Output**: TTS, GUI, log, or tool action
7. **Feedback**: User rates/edits, feedback logged
8. **Learning**: Self-analysis, prompt/rule updates, persona/tone adaptation

## üìã Immediate Focus (CPU-Only)
- [ ] Prompt feedback loop & analytics (GUI + memory)
- [ ] Rule-based intent/mood detection (regex, TextBlob, VADER)
- [ ] Memory-driven adaptation
- [ ] Knowledge search (ChromaDB/LlamaIndex)
- [ ] Persona/style switching (GUI + templates)
- [ ] Modularize all organs for easy extension

**All features and enhancements are designed to run efficiently on CPU-only systems. No GPU-required models are used for intent, mood, or core agent logic.**
