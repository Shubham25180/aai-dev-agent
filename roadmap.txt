==============================
🗺️ DETAILED ROADMAP (Phase-wise)
==============================

PHASE 1: CORE FOUNDATION (WEEK 1)
----------------------------------
✅ Setup main.py as sole entry point.

✅ Define strict modular file structure.

✅ Implement core routing and planning modules:
   - agents/planner.py
   - app/router.py

✅ Create basic execution modules:
   - executor/shell_ops.py
   - executor/gui_ops.py

✅ Initialize:
   - Logging to logs/actions/
   - Summaries to logs/step_summaries.log
   - Snapshots in undo/

✅ Add strict inline commenting style for all functions.

PHASE 2: MEMORY & STATE MANAGEMENT (WEEK 2)
--------------------------------------------
🔲 Implement:
   - memory/short_term.json
   - memory/long_term.json
   - memory/core_behavior.json (preferences, traits)

🔲 Build hook to update memory post-task.

🔲 Enable planner to read memory context before planning.

PHASE 3: VOICE SYSTEM INTEGRATION (WEEK 3)
-------------------------------------------
🔲 Build voice recognizer module (voice/recognizer.py) using Vosk or Whisper.

🔲 Add TTS output module (voice/responder.py) using pyttsx3 or Microsoft Edge voice API.

🔲 Implement voice command parser (voice/commands.py) to bridge voice to planner.

🔲 Add confidence check to voice commands for verification before execution.

PHASE 4: ADMIN EXECUTION MODE (WEEK 4)
---------------------------------------
🔲 Create secure prompt system for requesting elevated rights.

🔲 Allow PowerShell/CMD execution with elevation (via subprocess or elevation tools).

🔲 Isolate and label elevated commands in logs for auditing.

PHASE 5: ROBUST UI AUTOMATION (WEEK 5)
---------------------------------------
🔲 Integrate pyautogui and pynput for full GUI fallback support.

🔲 Implement:
   - Mouse movement
   - Keyboard input
   - Window focus & element click

🔲 Log all UI interactions with overlays or debug prints.

🔲 Add UI interaction preview (dry-run or pre-confirmation).

PHASE 6: NATURAL LANGUAGE + DEBUGGING TOOLS (WEEK 6)
-----------------------------------------------------
🔲 Integrate GPT-based task expansion in planner.py.

🔲 Add real-time debugging interface:
   - View command before execution
   - Edit or override

🔲 Create error classification and recovery mechanism:
   - Save to logs/errors/
   - Offer resolution suggestions

PHASE 7: USER EXPERIENCE POLISHING (WEEK 7)
--------------------------------------------
🔲 Enhance speech feedback with tones and timing.

🔲 Personality layer (relaxed, helpful vibe) added through language generation.

🔲 Improve terminal/chat interface:
   - Typing effect
   - Progress indicators
   - Cooldown timers or retries
